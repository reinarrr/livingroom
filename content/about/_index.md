This is the About page.

The Living Room is a home-centric, online-first, Bible-based, and Christ-centered community of believers who gather to grow in faith, support one another, and serve. It’s not about a building—it’s about people, all of us, living out God’s calling in everyday life.

{{< card title="A Chosen People" >}}

For you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God’s very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.

[1 Peter 2.9](https://ref.ly/1 Pet 2.9;esv?t=biblia)
