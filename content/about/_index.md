This is the About page.

The Living Room is a home-centric, online-first, Bible-based, and Christ-centered community of believers who gather to grow in faith, support one another, and serve. It’s not about a building—it’s about people, all of us, living out God’s calling in everyday life.

{{< card title="A Chosen People" >}}

For you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God’s very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.

[1 Peter 2.9](https://ref.ly/1 Pet 2.9;esv?t=biblia)

## Inside The Living Room

{{< columns >}}

##### Intimate Gatherings

We focus on smaller, more intimate gatherings in homes or online. It’s flexible and responsive to the needs of each community, allowing us to tailor how we worship and connect based on where we are and who we’re with.

##### Together in Faith

Our Sunday services, called ‘Sundays! in The Living Room,’ are available online, and many of our members gather in homes to watch together or participate in worship and study.

##### Authentic Connections

We gather in-person in homes, in Living Spaces, and online. We meet for worship, Bible study, prayer, and discussions. Each gathering is unique and reflects the needs and culture of their community.

##### Supergroups

Supergroups are the heart of connection at The Living Room. These small, intentional groups meet regularly to foster deeper relationships, encourage spiritual growth, and provide a space for open, honest conversations about faith and life.
